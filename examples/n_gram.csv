"ML", "Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification trees. In these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining a decision tree describes data but not decisions; rather the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making. This page deals with decision trees in data mining."

It belongs to the Pahuatlán municipality of the state of Puebla. Culturally it is dominated by the Otomi although it is part of the La Huasteca region."
"ML", "Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness.[1] Based on the concept of strong rules Rakesh Agrawal et al.[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example the rule \{\mathrm{onions potatoes}\} \Rightarrow \{\mathrm{burger}\} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as e.g. promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining intrusion detection Continuous production and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions."
"DF", "Premium-rate telephone numbers are telephone numbers for telephone calls during which certain services are provided and for which prices higher than normal are charged. Unlike a normal call part of the call charge is paid to the service provider thus enabling businesses to be funded via the calls. While the billing is different calls are usually routed the same way they are for a toll-free telephone number being anywhere despite the area code used. These telephone numbers are usually allocated from a national telephone numbering plan in such a way that they are easily distinguished from other numbers. Telephone companies typically offer blocking services to allow telephone customers to prevent access to these number ranges from their telephones. In some jurisdictions telephone companies are required by law to offer such blocking."
"ML", "In machine learning support vector machines (SVMs also support vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples each marked for belonging to one of two categories an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on."
"DF", "Erich Kohler (Portman) a crack Luftwaffe pilot who speaks fluent English is instructed by his superiors to drop a cargo of bombs on the Belgian city of Ghent and then to bale out of his plane wearing a British RAF uniform gain the confidence of the local populace and then try to convince them that the British are responsible for the bombing of civilian targets in Belgium. The plan goes awry when he falls into the hands of the Belgian Resistance who believe they are doing him a favour by arranging for him to be smuggled to Britain among a group of downed RAF pilots who are being returned that night."
"ML", "Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples background knowledge and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples."
"DF", "The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (typically abbreviated to TBIJ or 'the Bureau') is a nonprofit news organisation based in London. It was founded in 2010 to pursue investigations it deems to be in the public interest funded through philanthropy.[1] Though the Bureau publishes on its own website it typically acts more like a news agency working in collaboration with partner organisations to distribute stories.[2] Since its founding it has collaborated with Newsnight Panorama and File on 4 at the BBC Channel 4 News and Dispatches as well as the Financial Times The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Times among others.[3] Its managing editor is Rachel Oldroyd.[4]"
"ML", "A Bayesian network Bayes network belief network Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases."

"ML", "Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields including machine learning pattern recognition image analysis information retrieval and bioinformatics."
"DF", "A popular assembly (or people's assembly) is a gathering called to address issues of importance to participants. Assemblies tend to be freely open to participation and operate by direct democracy. Some assemblies are of people from a location some from a given workplace industry or educational establishment others are called to address a specific issue. The term is often used to describe gatherings that address what participants feel are the effects of a democratic deficit in a representative democratic systems.[1] Sometimes assemblies are created to form an alternative power structure other times they work with other forms of government."
"ML", "Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The problem due to its generality is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulation-based optimization multi-agent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms. In the operations research and control literature the field where reinforcement learning methods are studied is called approximate dynamic programming. The problem has been studied in the theory of optimal control though most studies are concerned with the existence of optimal solutions and their characterization and not with the learning or approximation aspects. In economics and game theory reinforcement learning may be used to explain how equilibrium may arise under bounded rationality."

"ML", "In machine learning feature learning or representation learning[1] is a set of techniques that learn a feature: a transformation of raw data input to a representation that can be effectively exploited in machine learning tasks. This obviates the need for manual feature engineering which is otherwise necessary and allows a machine to both learn at a specific task (using the features) and learn the features themselves: to learn how to learn."

She has explored the specific topic of covering as well as the complexities of living in a multicultural world.[1]"
"ML", "In probability and statistics density estimation is the construction of an estimate based on observed data of an unobservable underlying probability density function. The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population."

"ML", "Deep learning (deep structured learning hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers with complex structures or otherwise composed of multiple non-linear transformations.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning representations of data. An observation (e.g. an image) can be represented in many ways such as a vector of intensity values per pixel or in a more abstract way as a set of edges regions of particular shape etc. Some representations are better than others at simplifying the learning task (e.g. face recognition or facial expression recognition[9]) from examples. One of the promises of deep learning is replacing handcrafted features with efficient algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction.[10]"
"ML", "Sparse dictionary learning is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data (also known as coding) in the form of a linear combination of basis elements as well as those basis elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal. This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of representation space to be higher than the one of the input space. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple reconstruction ways but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation. One of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as fourier or wavelet transforms). However in certain cases the dictionary learned to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity and thus the results of signal processing."
"ML", "In a genetic algorithm a population of candidate solutions (called individuals creatures or phenotypes) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s but other encodings are also possible.[2] The evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and is an iterative process with the population in each iteration called a generation. In each generation the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness is usually the value of the objective function in the optimization problem being solved. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected from the current population and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. Commonly the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population."
"ML", "Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.[1] The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way (see inductive bias). The parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning."
"ML", "Unsupervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled there is no error or reward signal to evaluate a potential solution. This distinguishes unsupervised learning from supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Unsupervised learning is closely related to the problem of density estimation in statistics.[1] However unsupervised learning also encompasses many other techniques that seek to summarize and explain key features of the data. Many methods employed in unsupervised learning are based on data mining methods used to preprocess[citation needed] data."
"ML", "In machine learning and statistics classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. An example would be assigning a given email into spam or non-spam classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition. In the terminology of machine learning,[1] classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance."
"ML", "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables – that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution."
"ML", "Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics and data compression. Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances among the cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including values such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties."
"ML", "In machine learning, pattern recognition and in image processing, feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values (features) intended to be informative and non-redundant, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps, and in some cases leading to better human interpretations. Feature extraction is related to dimensionality reduction. When the input data to an algorithm is too large to be processed and it is suspected to be redundant (e.g. the same measurement in both feet and meters, or the repetitiveness of images presented as pixels), then it can be transformed into a reduced set of features (also named a features vector). This process is called feature selection. The selected features are expected to contain the relevant information from the input data, so that the desired task can be performed by using this reduced representation instead of the complete initial data."
"ML", "In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: dog and bone will appear more often in documents about dogs, cat and meow will appear in documents about cats, and the and is will appear equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document's balance of topics is. Although topic models were first described and implemented in the context of natural language processing, they have applications in other fields such as bioinformatics."

"DF", "Onward Victoria is a musical (1980) with a book and lyrics by Charlotte Anker and Irene Rosenberg, and music by Keith Herrmann. Its subject is Victoria Woodhull, the 19th-century woman who with her sister were the first women to operate a brokerage firm, at which they became millionaires; and started a newspaper. Woodhull was a proponent for free love and activist for equality of the sexes. Its cast of characters includes Cornelius Vanderbilt, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, restaurateur Charlie Delmonico, and Henry Ward Beecher, with whom Woodhull is linked in a fictional romance that leads to the minister being tried for alienation of affections. This musical originated in 1979 as Unescorted Women, first produced off-off-Broadway by the Joseph Jefferson Theatre Company. With its budget sets and costumes, anachronistic pop score, and camp burlesque-style production numbers (including one in which Woodhull sang the praises of Beecher's physical endowment) intact, headed uptown the following year rechristened Onward Victoria."
"DF", "The Melbourne Mint, in Melbourne, Australia, was a branch of the British Royal Mint. Until 1916 it minted only gold sovereigns, and all Australian coins between 1927 and 1967, when coin production moved to the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra. It is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and has been leased to the private sector since 2001. The former Royal Mint is located on the corner of William and Latrobe Streets (280-318 William Street and 387-429 Latrobe Street) and is of architectural significance as one of the most impressive 19th century government buildings in Victoria, and one of few Australian buildings in the true Renaissance revival style, and a virtual copy of the Palazzo Vidoni-Caffarelli, attributed to Raphael, in Rome (1515). The mint was built between 1869 and 1872 to the designs of architect J.J Clark whose other notable works included the Old Treasury Building, Melbourne. It was opened 12 June 1872[1] The colorful coat of arms placed on the front gates in mid-twentieth century were by the Melbourne woodcarver Walter Langcake. The original design, based on Queen Victoria's coat of arms, is adapted especially for a British Royal Mint branch office in colonial Victoria. The supporting animals are not crowned and a maned horse replaces the usual unicorn."

"DF", "Wireless tools for Linux is a collection of user-space utilities written for Linux kernel-based operating systems to support and facilitate the configuration of device drivers of wireless network interface controllers and some related aspects of networking using the Linux Wireless Extension. The Wireless tools for Linux and Linux Wireless Extension are maintained by Jean Tourrilhes[1] and sponsored by Hewlett-Packard. It is included with most operating system distributions built on the Linux kernel. In many Linux distributions, this package is included by default, or based on whether a wireless card is present. If it is not automatically installed by the distribution, it is usually easy to find in binary form. Due to the relative complexity of requiring several separate commands for one task (e.g. iwlist and iwconfig to find and sync with a wireless access point), some[2] recommend using frontends provided by GNOME and KDE, or an application called NetGo, to manipulate these settings."
