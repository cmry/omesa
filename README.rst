A small framework for reproducible Text Mining research that largely builds
on top of scikit-learn_. Its goal is to make common research procedures fully
automated, optimized, and well recorded. To this end it features:

- Exhaustive search over best features, pipeline options, to classifier optimization.
- Flexible wrappers to plug in your tools and features of choice.
- Completely sparse pipeline through hashing - from data to feature space.
- Record of all settings and fitted parts of the entire experiment, promoting reproducibility.
- Dump an easily deployable version of the final model for plug-and-play demos.

Important Note
''''''''''''''

This repository is currently in alpha development, so don't expect any stable
functionality until this part is removed. The `dev` branch will usually have the
latest (not always stable) version.

Front-end Preview
'''''''''''''''''''

.. _dev: https://github.com/cmry/omesa/tree/dev
.. _lime: https://github.com/marcotcr/lime

In 'front' a web front-end is being developed that uses a standalone
database for storing models. This provides visualization and comparison of
model performance. Some extra dependencies are introduced, such as ``bottle``,
``blitzdb``, ``plotly`` and lime_. Currently only the 'Results' section works,
preview below:

If you want to take a peek, install all above dependencies, do the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd /dir/to/omesa/examples
    $ python3 n_gram.py
    $ cd ../front
    $ python3 ./app.wsgi

And follow the ``localhost`` link that is shown to access the web app. Please
note that this part can be quite unstable. Bug reports are welcome.


Dependencies
''''''''''''

.. _Frog: https://languagemachines.github.io/frog/
.. _LaMachine: https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine/
.. _spaCy: https://spacy.io/

Omesa currently heavily relies on ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``sklearn``. To use
Frog_ as a Dutch back-end, we strongly recommend using LaMachine_. For
English, there is a spaCy_ wrapper available.

Omesa Only - End-To-End In 2 Minutes
------------------------------------

With the end-to-end ``Experiment`` pipeline and a configuration dictionary,
several experiments or set-ups can be ran and evaluated with a very minimal
piece of code. One of the test examples provided is that of n-gram
classification of Wikipedia documents. In this experiment, we are provided with
a toy set n_gram.csv that features 10 articles about Machine Learning, and 10
random other articles. To run the experiment, the following configuration is used:

With the end-to-end ``Experiment`` pipeline and a configuration dictionary,
several experiments or set-ups can be ran and evaluated with a very minimal
piece of code. One of the test examples provided is that of `n-gram classification`_
of Wikipedia documents. In this experiment, we are provided with a toy set
`n_gram.csv`_ that features 10 articles about Machine Learning, and 10 random
other articles. To run the experiment, the following configuration is used:

.. code-block:: python

    from omesa.experiment import Experiment
    from omesa.featurizer import Ngrams
    from omesa.containers import CSV
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

    Experiment(
        project="unit_tests",
        name="gram_experiment",
        train_data=CSV("n_gram.csv", data="gram", label="label"),
        lime_data=CSV("n_gram.csv", data="gram", label="label"),
        features=[Ngrams(level='char', n_list=[3])],
        classifiers=[
            {'clf': MultinomialNB()}
        ],
        "save": ("log")
    )

This will cross validate performance on the ``.csv``, selecting text
and label columns and indicating a header is present in the ``.csv`` document.
We provide the ``Ngrams`` function and parameters to be used as features, and
store the log.

Output
''''''

The log file will be printed during run time, as well as stored in the
script's directory. A sample from the output of the current experiment is as
follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    ---- Omesa ----

     Config:

            feature:   char_ngram
            n_list:    [3]

    	name: gram_experiment
    	seed: 42

     Sparse train shape: (20, 1301)

     Performance on test set:

                 precision    recall  f1-score   support

             DF       0.83      0.50      0.62        10
             ML       0.64      0.90      0.75        10

    avg / total       0.74      0.70      0.69        20

Adding own Features
-------------------

Here's an example of the most minimum word frequency feature class:

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeFeaturizer(object):

        def __init__(self, some_params):
            """Set parameters for SomeFeaturizer."""
            self.name = 'hookname'
            self.some_params = some_params

        def transform(self, raw, parse):
            """Return a dictionary of feature values."""
            return Counter([x for x in raw])

This returns a ``{word: frequency}`` dict per instance that can easily be
transformed into a sparse matrix.
