class Logger(object):
    """Provides feedback to the user and can store settings in a log file.

    Class holds a log string that can be formatted according to the used
    components and is used to list settings that are provided to the
    experiment. Aside from flat printing, it can iteratively store certain
    lines that are reused (such as loading in multiple datasets). The save
    function makes sure the self.log items are saved according to their logical
    order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : str
        File name of the logfile (and the experiment).

    Attributes
    ----------
    fn : str
        File name.

    log : dict
        Keys are short names for each step, values are strings with .format
        placeholders. Formatting is sort of handled by the strings as well.

    buffer : list
        Used to stack lines in a loop that can be written to the log line once
        the loop has been completed.
