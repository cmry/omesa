# Classes to log and display pipeline information


# Logger 

``` python 
 class Logger(file_name) 
```

Provides feedback to the user and can store settings in a log file.

Class holds a log string that can be formatted according to the used
components and is used to list settings that are provided to the
experiment. Aside from flat printing, it can iteratively store certain
lines that are reused (such as loading in multiple datasets). The save
function makes sure the self.log items are saved according to their logical
order.
